# Budget app
Project Description
The Budget App is a simple web application that helps users manage their income and expenses. Users can set a monthly budget, add income sources, track expenses, and view the remaining balance. The app displays all income and expenses in a detailed table and visualizes the expense distribution using a pie chart. The data is stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to track their progress even after refreshing the page.
